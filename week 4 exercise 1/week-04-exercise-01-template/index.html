        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="./devtool vandalism screenshot" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />
        </div>
        <h2>What I "Vandalized"</h2>
        <p>
            Describe the changes you made to the website using the browser's developer tools. Some potential questions
            to consider:
        <ul>
            <li>i changed the title of texas tech libraries to bookworms</li>
            <li>i mortify a background and color</li>
            <li>What made your edits interesting or amusing?</li>
            <li>yes, the name changed but the color didn't because the actual creator of website didn't made chamges </li>
            <li>i choose to change title to bookworms because it resembles the library people</li>
            <li>yes i was able to understand </li>
            <li>i think i understood at some extent how devtools can be used</li>
        </ul>
