                    This is the korean series based on webtoon called Annarasumaanara. this is my favorite series because 
                    this is based on fantasy and magic. its for the people who might had belived in magic once when they were kid
                    but then that wonder and spark got lost when they grew up.

                    These lantern lights are in mosque i prequently like to visit and i wouls say this is favorite part
                    of mosque for me because from here i could see the sunset and lanterns together and i have been
                    pretty big fan of tangled movie since i was a child so my love for lanterns came from there.

                    because they make my room look so good and they have stars too and who dont like watching stars so 
                    the combination of normal lights and star ones made me get these and i plan to buy more like these.

                    this song was made in 1998 which i was also suprised by becuase i just found out but i think its a 
                    really cool song and the fact that its a song from 190s is even more good. i like the cool tone of 
                    music video and the lyrics because they gives the vibe of summer evening on beach.

                    here comes my favorite card of this whole page. this is my cousin cat Milo that she addoped last year and
                    i used to be really scared of cats almost terrified. and whenever i would visit my cousin i was scared milo too just like other cats
                    but slowly i think i started to build a trust so this is why i would say it was the best thing that happened since now 
                    my fear of cats is almost gone.
